# Age-and-gender
Age and gender classification involves determining an individual's age and gender from images or videos, utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques. This process is widely applied in areas such as targeted marketing, security surveillance, and personalized user experiences.
Data Collection: Gathering diverse datasets containing labeled images or videos to train models effectively.

Feature Extraction: Identifying and analyzing facial features, such as wrinkles, skin texture, and bone structure, which are indicative of age and gender.

Model Training: Employing machine learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to learn patterns from the extracted features. For instance, a study demonstrated the use of CNNs for age and gender classification, achieving notable accuracy.
